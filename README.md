# SparseViz

SparseViz s a library built in C++ that orders and visualizes sparse data structures, i.e., matrices and tensors seamlessly. It also supports parallel CPU/GPU kernel execution and reports execution times of the kernels on the ordered data structures.  

The library is still in early stages of development. As a result, it may not stable and likely to change in the near future.
